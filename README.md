# FaceExpression-Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition System using CNN Algorithm and Deep Learning

Project Overview

The Facial Expression Recognition System is designed to detect and classify human facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Learning techniques. This project aims to automatically recognize different human emotions from facial images, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. The system is trained on a large dataset of facial images to achieve high accuracy in recognition.

Features

Automatic Detection of Facial Expressions: The system can recognize various facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprised, etc.

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for training and classification.

Dataset Preprocessing: Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation of images.

Real-time Prediction: Supports real-time emotion detection using a webcam.

High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in facial expression recognition due to CNN architecture.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Library: TensorFlow/Keras

Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Dataset: FER2013 or any other publicly available facial expression dataset

Dataset

The project uses the FER2013 dataset which contains facial images labeled with different expressions. The dataset can be downloaded from the official source or any public dataset repository.

Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed with the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extract important features from the input image.

Pooling Layers: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps.

Fully Connected Layers: Classify the images based on extracted features.

Activation Function: ReLU and Softmax are used for activation.

Working of the System

Data Collection: Input images are collected and preprocessed.

Training: The CNN model is trained on the dataset with labeled expressions.

Prediction: The trained model predicts the expression for a given input image.

Output: The system displays the detected emotion on the user interface.

Usage

For Real-time Detection: Use a webcam to capture real-time facial expressions.

For Image Testing: Provide a folder of images and test the system's accuracy.

Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% on the test dataset. It effectively recognizes various facial expressions and provides real-time predictions.

Future Improvements

Improve model accuracy by using transfer learning or larger datasets.

Deploy the model as a web application or mobile application.

Integrate the system with IoT devices or smart home assistants.
